# Set Auto Login

If you feel that it is troublesome to enter the password every time you log in to the account, you can set it to automatically log in without entering the password.

As shown in the figure, click the system setting interface and select 'Startup and Shutdown'.

Switch to Advanced as shown in the figure, click the box to select the user who is automatically logged in, and then click apply to complete the automatic login setting. Restarting your computer now will no longer require you to enter your login password.
